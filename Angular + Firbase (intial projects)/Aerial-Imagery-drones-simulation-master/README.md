# Description
Aerial imagery can save farmers a lot of time by giving them a bird’s eye view of crops(drones); that way, they can quickly get a sense of vegetation’s health, insect issues, irrigation layouts, and weed growth. It even allows them to precisely determine how much pesticide the crops require.
